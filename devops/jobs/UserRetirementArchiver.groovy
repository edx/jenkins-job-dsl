/*

Defines the job for archiving retired user statuses.

Job config variables consumed for this job (via extraVars):
  * ENVIRONMENT_DEPLOYMENT: The environment and deployment written as $environment-$deployment
  * FOLDER_NAME: Name of jenkins "folder" under which to put this job.
  * SECURE_GIT_CREDENTIALS: Name of jenkins git credential scoped to the UserRetirement "folder" in jenkins.
  * ACCESS_CONTROL: List of github groups with read and build access to this job.
  * ADMIN_ACCESS_CONTROL: List of github groups with full admin access to this job.
  * CRON: Optional. Defines the cron line for scheduling the job.
  * MAILING_LIST: Optional. A string containing a comma-delimited list of emails to notify when a build fails.

This job expects the following credentials to be defined on the folder:
  * tools-edx-jenkins-aws-credentials: file with key/secret in boto config format
  * ${environment}-${deployment}-retirement-archive-upload-role: the role to aws sts assume-role

This job archives and deletes user retirement statuses from the LMS database. However, these deletions
are replicated to Snowflake as "soft-deletes". In other words, they are marked as deleted and filtered
from downstream data views, but remain within Snowflake. Therefore, the statuses deleted by this job
are deleted from Snowflake with the following job:
