/*
    This job serves to watch https://github.com/edx/configuration for changes pushed to master. Upon a push to master, the job is 
    triggered via a webhook, at which point it runs the parsefiles.py script with the files changed between the old commit and the new commit. 
    This resolves which Docker images need to be rebuilt as a result of the aforementioned changes to the configuration repository. For each 
    Docker image that needs rebuilding, this job triggers the respective <app>-watcher downstream job, which then calls the image-builder job 
    to build and push up the respective image to DockerHub.

    Variables consumed from the EXTRA_VARS input to your seed job in addition
    to those listed in the seed job.

    APPS_TO_CONFIG: a dictionary containing mappings from an edX IDA to a dictionary of various configuration values (REQUIRED). 
        The structure of APPS_TO_CONFIG should be
        
        APPS_TO_CONFIG:
            <IDA name>:
                app_repo: <GitHub repository name for the IDA>
                app_repo_branch: <branch of the above repository to checkout>
                config_branch: <GitHub branch of configuration repository to checkout>
        For example, 
        APPS_TO_CONFIG:
            ecommerce:
                app_repo: 'ecommerce'
                app_repo_branch: 'master'
                config_branch: 'master'
        Note that the default for app_repo_branch is master, and the default for config_branch is master; therefore, they do not need to be specified unless you are providing overrides.
        
        For example,
        APPS_TO_CONFIG:
            ecommerce:
                app_repo: 'ecommerce'
                
        accomplishes the same as the dictionary above.
    CONFIGURATION_REPO_URL: URL of the configuration GitHub repository (REQUIRED).
    FOLDER_NAME: the name of the folder in which the downstream per-app jobs will live; defaults to DockerCI.
    ACCESS_CONTROL: list of github users or groups who will have access to the jobs.
    
    Expected credentials - these will normally be set up on the Folder.
    docker-config-json: a file credential that gives each job in the folder permission to push to DockerHub.
