/*
    This job handles changes to an application.

    For applications that have source code repositories, this job watches for changes pushed to master. 
    Upon a push to master, the job is triggered via a webhook. The job triggers the matching downstream image-builder job at
    DockerCI/image-builders/<app>-image-builder. The <app>-image-builder then builds and pushes the application's Docker image to DockerHub.

    For applications that do not have source code repositories, there are no watcher jobs, because there are no repositories to watch. If a new
    image for these applications is needed, the associated <app>-image-builder job will need to be run manually.

    Variables consumed from the EXTRA_VARS input to your seed job in addition
    to those listed in the seed job.
    
    APPS_TO_CONFIG: a dictionary containing mappings from an edX IDA to a dictionary of various configuration values (REQUIRED). 
        The structure of APPS_TO_CONFIG should be
        
        APPS_TO_CONFIG:
            <IDA name>:
                app_repo: <GitHub repository name for the IDA>
                app_repo_branch: <branch of the above repository to checkout>
                config_branch: <GitHub branch of configuration repository to checkout>
        For example, 
        APPS_TO_CONFIG:
            ecommerce:
                app_repo: 'ecommerce'
                app_repo_branch: 'master'
                config_branch: 'master'
        Note that the default for app_repo_branch is master, and the default for config_branch is master; therefore, they do not need to be specified unless you are providing overrides.
        
        For example,
        APPS_TO_CONFIG:
            ecommerce:
                app_repo: 'ecommerce'
                
        accomplishes the same as the dictionary above.
    EDX_REPO_ROOT: the URL of the edX GitHub organization (REQUIRED).
    FOLDER_NAME: the name of the folder in which the downstream per-app jobs will live; defaults to DockerCI.
    ACCESS_CONTROL: list of github users or groups who will have access to the jobs.
    
    Expected credentials - these will normally be set up on the Folder.
    docker-config-json: a file credential that gives each job in the folder permission to push to DockerHub.
